## 1 - [47 C++ Tutorials on Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3xo4bo/i_made_47_free_c_tutorials_on_youtube_and_wanted/)

Dear /r/learnprogramming,

I made a free C++ course for beginners and it seems relevant to share it with all of you here. It's a full introductory course made up of 47 lessons that start with "Hello World," assuming one has absolutely no programming experience, and goes on to cover loops, functions, vectors, and more. All the lessons all hosted on YouTube and organized into a course on my website. Hope you like it!

Here's a very comprehensive list of what an in-depth CS curriculum will cover: http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/

A lot of the material is probably going to be challenging for you to tackle right now, but it should give you a decent roadmap of what sorts of things you might want to work towards over the course of the next 5 to 6 years.

In particular, for you, I would suggest you **first start by just writing a lot of programs**. If you're interested in games, for example, try going out and making a bunch of games. Start with basic 2d ones (pong? space invaders?) and work your way up. If you're interested in mobile development, try making a mobile app, etc. The FAQ [links to some project ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_practice_exercises_and_project_ideas.3F) if you need some inspiration.

Programming is the sort of thing that **you need to be constantly practicing** in order to get better, and working on progressively more challenging projects is the best way to become fluent with coding in general. In particular, learning computer science will be much easier if you're a fluent coder/don't need as much help with the actual mechanics of programming something new and solving problems.

Along the way, I would recommend studying **data structures and algorithms**, which is the stepping stone and foundation of computer science.

Here are some resources (some free, some not) on data structures and algorithms. I can't say I've vetted them all very thoroughly, and some of them assume a decent amount of mathematical maturity and so might be a challenging read at present time. I've ordered them very roughly in terms of accessibility (except for the Big-O cheatsheet, which is more of a standalone supplemental resource).

**Just googling things is also pretty effective**. If there's a specific CS topic you'd like to learn more about, googling that topic can often yield useful results. Like seriously, that's how I got started with programming and computer science. I didn't really take classes or read books so much as just work on a bunch of programs/spend a lot of time googling and reading when I encountered a new concept, and I learned a tremendous amount this way.

I would also encourage you to **pay attention to your math, science, and English classes in school**. Math and science are both very useful tools when you're trying to solve interesting problems, and computer science, to a certain degree, is an applied math degree. 

Take machine learning, for example -- it's a field of study which involves teaching a computer to teach itself, and is used to power things like Google's search engine, self-driving cars, AIs, and so forth. If you're interested in working in this field, you'd need a solid understanding of statistics, which in turn requires a solid understanding of math...

(I do want to also mention that the kind of math you do in computer science is unlikely to be directly related to the kind of math you're going to do now through high school -- in computer science, you learn things like writing proofs, logic, number theory, statistics, and so forth. Before college, most schools will focus on things like algebra, trig, geometry, and calculus. Those things are all very useful, don't get me wrong, but they do feel "different".)

English is also useful in general -- being able to communicate effectively and persuade others is a very useful skill. Somewhat more pragmatically, people will, for better or for worse, often not take you as seriously or will discount what you have to say if you're not an effective writer, which isn't the greatest feeling in the world.

## 4 - [How I learned to develop Android apps in less than a year](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1s347g/how_i_learned_to_develop_android_apps_in_less/)
### [Here's the link to the blog post on my website (no ads)](http://codescrubs.com/blog/how-i-learned-to-develop-android-apps-in-less-than-a-year)
*****  
A year ago I had a basic grasp of Python and I knew some HTML and CSS. Two weeks ago I published my first proper Android app and I’m being offered jobs as a web developer.

This is how I started learning programming.

*****
### **Background**

A year ago my knowledge of programming was rudimentary. I did the [codecadamy courses](http://www.codecademy.com/), did a few tutorials on HTML and CSS, and that was it. I knew how to modify my WordPress photo blog and nothing more. While I always had an affinity for logic and how things work, as a student of social studies, I never actually came into contact with programming.

However that changed when I was installing a custom rom on my Android phone. The operation was quite simple with an easy to follow tutorial. **If I successfully changed my phone’s operating system, how hard is to create a simple app for it?** So right then and there I decided to learn how to program Android apps.

 *****

### **The plan**

*How do I get started with programming?* Probably the most important and most often asked question. I spent hours searching for tutorials and guides on where to start. After a while a learning plan started to take shape. The plan consisted of not just the things I needed to learn to make a simple Android app, but also the **fundamentals** of programming that would help me in other areas as well (especially web development).

The plan was simple. Learn programming principles and its fundamentals. Learn about clean code and working with others. Then learn how Android works and put it all together in a simple app.

1. Learn programming
1. Learn the Android SDK
1. Create an app
1. ???
1. Profit!
 
*****
### **Putting the plan in action**

The plan was set and off I went. I spent the first two months on [this Stanford video on introduction to programming.](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A/194) It focuses on Java which was perfect as Android uses the Java programming language (killed two birds with one stone). I also grabbed a couple of Java books and did all the lessons in them, and I even watched all of the [Clean code videos](http://cleancoders.com/) (even those that I didn’t understand at the time). *Check out the [tutorials](http://codescrubs.com/resources) for a list of other helpful resources.*

Once I knew the basics of programming and Java, I started learning how the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) works. That was **really really** hard to do. It took me a couple of months just to learn the basics of how a simple Android app works. The whole ordeal was time-consuming and stressful, but seeing my apps actually working on my phone, was awesome. That kept me going. That was the **only** thing that kept me going.

Then it clicked. **It all became super simple.** I knew where to look for solutions and how to code them. In the next couple of months I created several personal apps: a Dungeons and dragons app that taught me how to use fragments; a WordPress app that taught me networking and APIs; a Tetris app that taught me simple game development. Programming became fun and simple and something I wanted  to do as much as possible.

I never thought myself being a programmer, so publishing my first app was a weird experience. I felt as an imposter, because I used StackOverflow, tutorials and code snippets from other people. Then I realized that the only thing that matters is the finished app. So I published [WordRefresh](http://codescrubs.com/blog/wordrefresh-android-app), a simple app that shows you words and their definitions. The app itself is **not** important – the important thing is that I successfully learned how to develop and code Android apps.

My learning plan **actually worked.**

### **What I learned**

It’s been an interesting year. I learned that the most important lesson is successfully balancing the three *main resources* every person has.

#### **Time**

Finding time to learn is hard. In the past year, I completed all of my college classes, got a job, went through 3 intense relationships and had knee surgery that confined me to a bed for three months. You have to find time to learn and actually code. I coded while my League of Legends game was loading. Five minutes here and five minutes there, it adds up.

#### **Knowledge**

Learning how to program is hard. You will spend hours searching for simple solutions and the most basic of logic. It’s a fact. You have to learn to walk before you can run. First you learn about printing statements to console, then you learn how to do network calls and SQL queries. Master the basics, then branch out. Don’t rush it.

#### **Motivation**

Being motivated to learn is hard. You will get stressed out on simple things. Debugging is as fun as self-inflicted paper cuts. Failing at simple tasks is disheartening. So set yourself small goals that keep you motivated. You just fixed a bug? Be proud. You’re awesome. Then try to fix another one. Take care of your motivation, because it’s pretty important when every simple problem takes hours to solve.

A successful learning plan balances the three main resources. Having time without motivation is **procrastination**. Having motivation, but no time, is **stressful**. Break down things into simple, easily achievable chunks. Then do them.

*****

**Final thoughts**

**I am not a programmer**, and I feel awkward when people say that I’m a developer. I’m just a 25-year-old dude that was bored and likes doing tutorials and learning new things. Now I’m making a career out of this stuff. Even though my initial learning plan is complete, learning how to program is a neverending task. Onwards and upwards.

It’s been hard, It’s been stressful and it’s been the most fun I ever had.
