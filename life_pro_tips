## 1 - [Don't name your resume file 'Resume' (and other resume tips)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/221kiu/lpt_dont_name_your_resume_file_resume_and_other/)

I just had to wade through 100+ resumes, and I noticed a few mistakes that many people seem to make.

1. Don't name the file "Resume" or any variation of that.  After going through 100 resumes, I had a short list of 20 candidates that I needed to whittle down to 5 or 10 people to interview.  I went through the directory looking for the 20 resumes to review again in more detail, and could only find 14.  I'm assuming the other 6 are somewhere the generic mass of 30 or so files titled "Resume" or something like that, but I'll be damned if I'm going to wade through them all to check.  **Your resume file name should start with your actual name!**

2. Don't make me scroll to the third page to find your previous experience.  If your hobbies, education and "strengths" are listed before your work experience, I'll assume you don't have any.  That's fine for entry level jobs, but when the position requires 3 or more years of relevant experience, if I assume you don't have that by the end of the first page of your resume, I'm closing the file and moving on.

3. If you're applying to a job posted on Linkedin, and you don't have a resume file attached to your profile for the recruiter to download, you're probably not getting considered for the job.  I don't care how good your Linkedin profile is, attach a resume when you apply for a job.

4. Resumes should be ~~2 pages~~ *as short as possible, but as long as they need to be to convey what's important*.  One extra page for a cover letter is fine, but never give me a two page cover letter, because I'm in a hurry.  *For entry level and junior positions,* anything more than 2 just seems long winded, and makes me think you can't prioritize, anything less than two pages just seems wrong for some reason.  (Entry level people who have little or no experience, make it exactly 1 page, and if you're applying for a senior management position, make it as long as you need to.)

5. Different job sites attach the cover letter differently.  For Workopolis, the cover letter is embedded in the email they send you to let you know a candidate has applied.  So unless the person who is collecting the resumes manually copies the cover letter into a file, and then saves it along with your resume, the people reviewing your resume won't see the cover letter.  Cover letters are not absolutely essential for every job, but if you're going to add one, include it in the same file as your resume.

There's tonnes of good resume advice out there, but I hadn't seen this advice before, and I thought it might be useful.  Also, just FYI, if you say "detail oriented" on your resume, and I spot an error, I'll still consider you, but I'll make fun of you in the interview to see how you handle it.

Edits: Stuff, also:

*0. Never take resume advice as gospel. Anything that one HR person tells you, another one will disagree with.*

Finally, the whole point here is that anything you can do to make the job of the hiring manager easier **helps you**.  This isn't about you, it's about a hiring manager who has to root through hundreds of resumes sometimes.  Keep that in mind when you write yours, and you'll have a leg up.

## 2 - [Chrome extensions I wish I knew back when I started college](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/51av2h/lpts_chrome_extensions_i_wish_i_knew_of_back_when/)
As I am about to enter my grad school I have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. As a result, I recently started exploring Chrome extensions, and man I wish I had done this earlier. Some will no longer be of use to me but I hope it can help others. 

[**Cite This For Me: Web Citer**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
This one hurts me a bit as my days with MLA, APA, Harvard, and Chicago are coming to an end. The extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. From my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as EasyBib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

[**Google Dictionary**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
If you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). It's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. I imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

[**Grammarly for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
I often use bad grammar and I know it. This extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. It highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

[**Readability**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
This extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. I would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article I'd give this a shot. 

[**SpeakIt!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-US)

I know I can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. This app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. Or I guess you could take notes as you listen too...

It works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand German-English accents over the default one). You can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. I could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but I would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

[**Block & Focus**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

Type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. Manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. There are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

[**MolView**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

I haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in O-Chem or higher. It allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. I was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what I'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**Bonus Tips That I Learned**


***Make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** Leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. It will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***Use [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** It's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. I cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as I stayed up too late studying. 

***Use [RainyMood](https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** I'm sure many of you know about it but I love this one.

I'm sure I have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. Feel free to tell me any I should try out! 

**Use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your PC screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -Credit to KreekyBonez for that one!

Good luck in your studies my friends!

EDIT: Cleaned up the post and added the links to the extensions. Also added Flu.x per KreekyBonez as it is one I think people should be aware of.

EDIT: Thanks for the love guys, this blew up way more than I expected! Glad to help. Wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments.

I hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. It isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **Always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. But if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. Just wanted to throw that out there as many Redditors have been commenting on those two extensions. Otherwise thanks for all the suggestions and upvotes of course!

 - The Great Suspender. Have a ton of tabs opened? This suspends the ones you're not or haven't used in a while. If you're on a chromebook or laptop it keeps performance stable and reduces battery drain. 

EDIT: Here are some other extensions that I am a fan of:

- Facebook Purity - You know all the stupid stuff your friends and family post? Block it. Block the trending, block key phrases, block all those memes.

- Data Saver - An official Google extension. Using a hotspot with limited data? This can ease the dent in your data plan.

- uBlock Origin - The best adblocker.

- h264ify - Mainly use it with Chromebooks. Helps reduce lag, stutters, and bufferings when watching 1080p videos on lower end machines.

- Honey - Automatic coupon clipper. Use it when you're checking out. Works with a ton of online retailers.

## 3 - [Another waybto write fast, well-constructed papers.(https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/136zs4/lpt_another_way_to_write_fast_wellconstructed/)

In college I had a professor that changed the way I wrote papers forever. After his class I became an English major and loved writing papers.

He gave a formula to our class: If you had an eight page paper to write, that means you need to write roughly 16 paragraphs. If you write an introductory paragraph and conclusion, that leaves 14 body paragraphs. Write down 14 ideas that support your thesis, rearrange them to make sure there is a natural thought progression, and before you know it you had an 8-page well-structured essay.

Hope this helps!

I'll add a few tips.  As a humanities grad student I usually have to write two or three 20-page papers at a time.

* Outlines are annoying, but it'll cut the time it take you to write a paper in half.  It lets you see how your ideas fit together, so you can move them around and organize them without having to re-write entire paragraphs or pages.  If you write without outlines you probably find that you often get stuck on a certain point and can't move forward.  The outline will let you progressively flesh out the whole paper without hitting a writer's block.  Use the outline to strategically place your quotes and make sure they're all well-supported.  The word you should always be keeping in mind is "Because."  Every claim you make should be "because of" several examples from your sources.  Every quote should have a "he says this because..."  If you can't think of any "because"s for a certain idea, it should not be in your paper.  Once you have an outline, all you should need to do is fill it in with transition and topic sentences.

* The intro and conclusion paragraphs should be last things you write.  In the course of writing a paper you will almost definitely reach conclusions or think of new ideas that didn't occur to you when you set out.  If you get too attached to your original intro and thesis statement, you risk fudging your results to fit your hypothesis, when you should really make your thesis fit your findings.  Your introduction should be written like you're trying to explain the paper to a friend who doesn't know anything about the topic.  Your conclusion should be written like you're trying to explain to your professor why your paper is important.

* Topic sentences:  It should be possible to read only the first and last sentences of each paragraph and still understand what your paper is saying.  Not only should they capture the point of the paragraph, they should indicate how one paragraph leads to the other.

* Here is my personal technique for organizing my research.  It's time consuming, but I find it extremely useful.  When doing your reading, keep a word document open and transcribe passages from the books or articles, with page numbers.  Not just quotes you intend to use, but the key points in every source, so that you can review them easily without going back to the book every time.  A good writer will stop occasionally to summarize succinctly what he's just said.  Collect these key sentences in your notes and you will always have an easy guide to each of your sources, not to mention that simply writing it all down will help it stick in your brain. 90% of what you've copied out won't make it into your paper (I sometimes wind up with 30 pages of notes for a 15 page paper), but you will be able to easily copy-paste quotes into your paper, and remember how they fit into the original article, so you don't risk misinterpreting.  

## 4 - [LPT: There is a visible difference between not working out at all and doing 15 pushups every day. Make 15 push ups your new 'not working out'.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/4yk6f7/lpt_there_is_a_visible_difference_between_not/)

If you do not work out, do 15 pushups every day. It does not sound like much but it makes a huge long term difference to not working out. It does not take long and it makes a visible difference. 
If you struggle with 15, do 10. If 15 make you smile do 20.

Edit: Because of people messaging/commenting about injury and muscle imbalance: This is not meant to replace your workout routine nor is it meant to be your goto routine for the next 5 years.  
The LPT is meant to be: Even a tiny workout can go a long way. Warm up. Mix it up. But don't think working out only works if you spend 3 days a week in the gym. There is a wide gap between not working out at all and doing 5-10 minutes every day. You can see that difference and you can feel it. Some say even a few dong chin ups every other day can go a long way ...
